- [x] [T1] Encode the authoritative lifecycle transition table in code (e.g. constants + helper) covering: `enqueue`, `claimNext`, `start`, `heartbeat`, `complete`, `fail`, `stall`, `requeueStalled`, including allowed source→target statuses and permitted no-op repeats.
- [x] [T2] Extend contract-level validation (building on `validateTransitionInvariants`) to enforce per-status invariants: required/forbidden `owner` + `lease`, required terminal `result`/`error` shapes, and immutability rules for terminal states.
- [x] [T3] Define and export canonical event type vocabulary for lifecycle transitions (e.g. `enqueued|claimed|started|heartbeat|succeeded|failed|stalled|requeued`) and add helper(s) to build `JobEvent` records consistently (without breaking forward compatibility of parsing `type: string`).
- [x] [T4] Codify attempt + revision semantics as reusable helpers (e.g. when `attempt` increments, when `rev` must increase, and when idempotent retries must not), so queue implementations can reuse the same rules.
- [x] [T5] Add unit tests (`bun:test`) that cover the happy-path lifecycle: `queued → claimed → running → succeeded` and `queued → claimed → running → failed`, asserting invariants at each step.
- [x] [T6] Add unit tests that reject illegal transitions and invalid invariants (examples: `queued → running`, `claimed → succeeded`, `running → queued`, terminal → non-terminal; missing `owner`/`lease` in `claimed`/`running`; `result` on `failed`; `error` on `succeeded`).
- [x] [T7] Add tests for retry/idempotency expectations at the contract-policy layer: retry-safe actions require `request_id`, heartbeats can be no-op status transitions (`running → running`, `claimed → claimed`), and repeated terminal writes are treated as immutable/idempotent.
- [x] [T8] Ensure lifecycle policy changes remain aligned with plan 01’s contract surface (no schema breaking changes) and that `bun test` + `bun run typecheck` pass.
