- [x] [T1] Specify and codify a v1 job schema in code (TypeScript types) that is JSON-serializable and includes: `job_id`, `contract_version`, `dedupe_key`, `target` (epic/plan/iteration/command), `status`, `attempt`, `rev`, `owner`, `lease`, `events`, and terminal `result`/`error` shapes.
- [x] [T2] Define a minimal, implementation-agnostic queue interface (method signatures + required atomicity/CAS semantics) for: enqueue (idempotent), claim (exclusive + leased), heartbeat/renew, complete, fail, stall/reclaim hooks, and read/list operations.
- [x] [T3] Add contract-level invariants as executable checks (pure functions) for validating state transitions and ownership constraints (e.g. “terminal is immutable”, “only owner can complete”, “CAS on rev required”), without encoding detailed lifecycle policy from plan 02.
- [x] [T4] Add a small test suite (`bun:test`) that round-trips representative contract objects through JSON and validates versioning/forward-compat behavior (unknown fields ignored, unsupported `contract_version` rejected).
- [x] [T5] Document the mapping from current plan phases/allowed next commands to job `target.workflow_command` (and required inclusion of `plan_iteration`) so later dispatcher/worker plans can rely on a single canonical mapping point.
- [x] [T6] Define the idempotency contract surface (fields and semantics) needed for later suppression logic: `dedupe_key` scope and `request_id` for transition operations, explicitly deferring the concrete key format to plan 03.
- [x] [T7] Define the ownership/lease contract surface (fields and semantics) needed for later lease tuning: required owner identity fields, lease expiry/renewal fields, and what a consumer must do on expiry, explicitly deferring lease durations/reclaim policy to plan 04.
