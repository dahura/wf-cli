# Documentation Language — English Only

## Rule

- All project documentation MUST be written in **English**.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- `plans/**/plan.md`
- `plans/**/todo.md`
- `plans/**/review.md`
- any `README.md` / docs / design notes
- commit / PR descriptions when authored by the agent

## Allowed

- Code identifiers, UI labels, and user-provided quotes may remain in their original language.
- If the user writes requirements in another language, keep the quotes as-is but write the doc text in English.

## Quick example

- ✅ Good: “Investigate table/footer misalignment caused by scrollbar gutter differences.”
- ❌ Bad: “Разобраться почему таблица едет вправо.”
