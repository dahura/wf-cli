# Epic Orchestration Rule

## Purpose

Defines strict behavior for epic orchestration mode.

## Activation

Apply when user runs:

- `/epic run <id>`
- `/epic resume <id>`

## Orchestrator Responsibilities

- The main chat is the orchestrator.
- The main chat must coordinate plan lifecycle transitions.
- The main chat must invoke specialized subagents for implementation work.

## Forbidden Behavior

- Do not implement feature code directly in orchestration mode.
- Do not fix review findings directly in orchestration mode.
- Do not stop and ask user to run `/fix` during epic orchestration when fix loop can continue automatically.

## Required Loop

For each plan:

1. planning -> invoke `@epic-planner` if plan/todo files are empty
2. `/code <id>` -> invoke `@plan-coder`
3. `/review <id>` -> invoke `@plan-reviewer`
4. if issues: `/fix <id>` -> invoke `@plan-fixer` -> `/finish-code <id>` -> `/review <id>`
5. repeat review/fix until `/done <id>` or plan becomes `blocked`

## Parallelization Policy

- Planner subagents may run in parallel for independent plans.
- Coder/reviewer/fixer subagents may run in parallel only for independent plans with safe file ownership boundaries.
- If independence is unclear, process sequentially.

## Safety

- If any plan enters `blocked`, stop orchestration and report.
- If any command fails, report failure and stop.
