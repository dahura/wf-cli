# Bun Package Manager Rule

## Purpose

This rule defines **Bun** as the mandatory package manager
for this project.

Using a single package manager ensures:
- consistent dependency resolution
- reproducible installs
- faster development workflows

---

## Rule

- **Bun MUST be used** as the package manager for this project
- `bun install` is the only allowed way to install dependencies
- `bun add`, `bun remove`, `bun update` must be used for dependency changes

---

## Forbidden Tools

The following package managers **must not be used**:

- npm
- yarn
- pnpm

Lockfiles generated by these tools must not be committed.

---

## Scripts and Commands

- Use `bun run` to execute scripts
- Project scripts must be compatible with Bun runtime

---

## Rationale

Bun provides:
- faster installs
- built-in TypeScript support
- integrated runtime, bundler, and test runner

Standardizing on Bun reduces tooling complexity
and avoids cross-package-manager issues.

---

## Compliance

Any contribution that:
- introduces another package manager
- adds non-Bun lockfiles
- relies on npm/yarn/pnpm commands

is considered non-compliant and must be fixed.

---

## Summary

- Bun is the only package manager
- Other managers are forbidden
- All installs and scripts run through Bun
