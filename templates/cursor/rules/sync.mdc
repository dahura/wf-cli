# Sync Rules — Multi-Editor Rules Sync

## Purpose

This file initializes and defines a **multi-way synchronization**
between rule sets for:

- Cursor (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`)
- KiloCode (`.kilocode/rules/*.md`)
- OpenCode (`.opencode/rules/*.md`)
- Antigravity (`.agents/rules/*.md`, `.agents/skills/*.md`, etc.)

All `.agents` subfolders (rules, skills, etc.) use the same sync logic and structure; files use `.md` extension.

After initialization, all sides are equal.
No editor is a permanent source of truth.

---

## Initialization

On first execution:
- Create missing rules folders
- Generate missing sync files
- Strip editor-specific syntax where required

---

## Sync Behavior

- Multi-way synchronization (Cursor ↔ KiloCode ↔ OpenCode ↔ Antigravity `.agents`)
- Latest modified file wins
- Semantic content only is synchronized
- Editor-specific syntax is adapted per target

---

## Conflict Resolution

- Newer timestamp wins
- Equal timestamps → Cursor version preferred
- Conflicts are logged

---

## Safety Rules

- Never delete files automatically
- Never sync outside rules folders or `.agents` subfolders
- Never mix formats

---

## Summary

This file bootstraps the sync process. The `.agents` folder (Antigravity) participates with the same behavior: equivalent subfolders like `rules`, `skills`, etc., and `.md` files only.
